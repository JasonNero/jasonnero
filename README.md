# Hi there :wave:

My name is **Jason Sch√ºhlein**, and I'm a researcher and software engineer from Germany.  
I've recently graduated as M.Eng. with a focus on deep learning and computer graphics.  
Currently I work at [HdM Stuttgart](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de), researching **human motion generation** and **conversational voice AI**.

In previous positions I worked on **object pose estimation** and **synthetic data** for the Fraunhofer IPA, and as **Pipeline developer** for Accenture Song (formerly Mackevision).
